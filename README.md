# Detection as Code

Welcome to the **Detection as Code Pipeline** repository! This project aims to streamline and enhance threat detection through a robust, scalable pipeline built on the principles of "detection as code." This repository provides a comprehensive solution for creating, testing, and deploying detection rules in a systematic and automated manner.

## 📋 Overview

The Detection as Code Pipeline is designed to bridge the gap between detection engineering and development practices. It enables security teams to define, test, and manage detection rules as code, ensuring that these rules are both effective and maintainable. This approach brings the benefits of version control, automated testing, and continuous integration to the realm of security detection.

## 🚀 Features

- **Detection as Code**: Define and manage your detection rules in code, making them easily versioned and reviewed.
- **Automated Testing**: Run automated tests on your detection rules to ensure their accuracy and effectiveness before deployment.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment and updating of detection rules.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with your organization's needs, handling complex rule sets and large datasets efficiently.
- **Documentation and Examples**: Comprehensive documentation and example configurations to get you started quickly.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for containerized environments)
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [Elastic_Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/security-apis.html)


### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<repo>.git
   cd detection-as-code
   ```

2. **Set Up CI Environment**
   
   Use Github Actions/ Juenkins as you wish
   If needed, create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the Pipeline**

   Update the configuration files located in the `config` directory. Refer to `config/README.md` for detailed instructions on setting up the environment and defining your detection rules.

5. **Run the Pipeline**

   Start the pipeline using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   Or run locally:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

To ensure your detection rules are functioning as expected, run the following one by one:
1. craft_json.py
2. create_rile.py
3. check_query_main.py

## 📝 Documentation

For detailed information on how to use and customize the Detection as Code refere to the comments within the code.
